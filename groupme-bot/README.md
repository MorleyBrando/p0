# P0: GroupMe Bot

# About the Bot

This is a simple groupmebot called Brand0Bot. The bot will respond to anyone that says good morning or good night in the cmsc389t-winter groupme chat. Otherwise he will only respond to me. He also uses the Giphy API to get gifs if I use the keyword giphy in my message. 

# How to run it

To use the bot you have to run the virtual environment by running the command source venv/bin/activate in the terminal. After doing that you simply have to run python3 bot.py and the bot will be running.
